## Self-Reflection:
I have a better understanding of implenting tradtional games in Javascript, but I'm
still a bit confused on Phaser itself, would be helpful to have a list of all its 
available commands. I'd also like to know why I couldn't use this.varName inside functions,
does it have to how variables are stored in classes?

Around 8 hours
